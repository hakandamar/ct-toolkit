# Computational Theseus Toolkit

## Project Overview & Roadmap

---

## Project Overview

CT Toolkit is an open-source Python library that brings the **Nested Agency Architecture (NAA)** framework — proposed in Hakan Damar's _"The Computational Theseus: Engineering Identity Continuity as a Guardrail Against Sequential Self-Compression in Multi-Agent AGI Systems"_ (2025) — into engineering practice.

### The Problem It Solves

An agentic system can drift from its initial value commitments over time. The paper defines this phenomenon as **Sequential Self-Compression (SSC)**: the model progressively compresses its prior normative states in service of immediate objective functions. This risk is significant in single-model systems — and **systemic** in multi-agent architectures, where an SSC event at the orchestrator level cascades across the entire sub-agent population.

### The Approach

CT Toolkit addresses this by treating **identity continuity as a first-class system constraint**. It is installed not inside the model, but around the **orchestration layer**, making it compatible with both open-source and proprietary models.

### Current State
