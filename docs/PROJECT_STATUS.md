# Computational Theseus Toolkit

## Project Overview & Roadmap

---

## Project Overview

CT Toolkit is an open-source Python library that brings the **Nested Agentic Architecture (NAA)** framework — proposed in Hakan Damar's _"The Computational Theseus: Engineering Identity Continuity as a Guardrail Against Sequential Self-Compression in Multi-Agent AGI Systems"_ (2026 - 2nd edition) — into engineering practice.

**Current Version:** `v0.3.19`

### The Problem It Solves

An agentic system can drift from its initial value commitments over time. The paper defines this phenomenon as **Sequential Self-Compression (SSC)**: the model progressively compresses its prior normative states in service of immediate objective functions. This risk is significant in single-model systems — and **systemic** in multi-agent architectures, where an SSC event at the orchestrator level cascades across the entire sub-agent population.

### The Approach

CT Toolkit addresses this by treating **identity continuity as a first-class system constraint**. It is installed not inside the model, but around the **orchestration layer**, making it compatible with both open-source and proprietary models.

## Developer Validation Example

For developers who want to test CT Toolkit inside a minimal application instead of only running isolated scripts, see [**ct-toolkit-fastapi**](https://github.com/hakandamar/ct-toolkit-fastapi). It provides a FastAPI-based integration suite that exercises L1/L2/L3 guardrails and provenance logging against local LM Studio and Ollama services.
